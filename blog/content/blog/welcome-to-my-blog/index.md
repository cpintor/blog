I would like to begin 2021 by starting out a new bloging project where I will hopefully commit to blogging throughout the year and beyond. I aim to post here my journey through web development, as I am set to graduate this year in May (I am beyond terrified). I will also post some of my photos, which I will work on creating my own potfolio page on my [main site](https://cpintor.github.io). 

I hope you can stay for a while and explore my blog and website.
